pretty much exclusively typescript at this point.

languages i know with varying degrees of profiency, although all at a reasonable level:
- typescript (too much)
- javascript (too much)
- c++        (quite a lot)
- c          (i know the concepts, no actual projects)
- c#         (i know the concepts, some small projects)

i have used:
- express    (a lot)
- vue        (some)
- svelte     (a lot)
- node.js    (too much)
- deno       (node.js but worse, some)
- redis      (some)
- mongodb    (some)
- discord.js (too much)

i have experience in:
- discord api (a lot)
- scratch.mit.edu api (way too much to be proud of)
- DTLS (basic, i'm not proud of it (https://github.com/SkeldJS/SkeldJS/tree/master/packages/dtls))

i also have *a lot* of experience in among us if that's useful to anyone
