pretty much exclusively typescript at this point.

languages i know with varying degrees of profiency, although all at a reasonable level:
- typescript (everything)
- javascript
- c++        (non-malicious game hacking, udp sockets) 
- c          (udp sockets)
- c#         (game modding)

i have used:
- express 
- vue         (veutify)
- svelte      (sapper, sveltekit, routify, svelte-material-ui)
- node.js
- deno
- redis       (caching, game load-balancing)
- mongodb     (mongoose/typegoose)
- discord api (too much, discord.js, made my own library)
- dtls (i'm not proud, https://github.com/SkeldJS/SkeldJS/tree/master/packages/dtls)

i also have *a lot* of experience in among us if that's useful to anyone
